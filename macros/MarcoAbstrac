In order to enlarge the discovery potential of the LHC for new particles, an increase of the design-luminosity is under investigation. This upgrade will require much higher performance of the LHC detectors, in particular in terms of radiation tolerance of the inner tracking systems.
The active pixel sensors based on High-Voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) technology is being investigated as a viable option for the ATLAS experiment. HV-CMOS technology allows implementation of a low-cost detector with excellent radiation-tolerance. In particular the characterization of prototype sensors produced by Austria Micro-Electronics will be presented covering both the functional characterization in LHEP laboratory and the test beam performance at CERN SPS.
